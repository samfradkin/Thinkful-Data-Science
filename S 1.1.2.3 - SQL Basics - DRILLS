Let's confirm some of this new knowledge with a few basic exercises. Write SQL queries to return:


1) The IDs and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration.

SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration
FROM
	trips
WHERE
	duration > 500
ORDER BY duration ASC;


2) Every column of the stations table for station id 84.

SELECT
	*
FROM
	stations
WHERE
	station_id = 84;
  
  
3) The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301.
 
SELECT
	mintemperaturef
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	events LIKE 'Rain' AND
	zip = 94301;
