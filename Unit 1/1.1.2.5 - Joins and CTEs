What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

WITH rainydays
AS (
	SELECT DATE(date) rain_date
	FROM weather
	WHERE events LIKE 'Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration
FROM trips t
JOIN rainydays r
on DATE(t.start_date) = r.rain_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3


Which station is full most often?

SELECT
	status.station_id,
	stations.name,
COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 THEN 1 END) unavailable
FROM status
JOIN stations
ON stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY unavailable DESC
LIMIT 1


Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT
	trips.start_station,
	stations.dockcount,
	COUNT(*) as tripcount
FROM trips
JOIN stations
ON stations.name = trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC


(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

WITH rainydays
AS (
	SELECT DATE(date) rain_date
	FROM weather
	WHERE events LIKE 'Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
),
rainytrips AS (
	SELECT
		t.trip_id,
		t.duration,
		DATE(t.start_date) rainytripdate
	FROM trips t
	JOIN rainydays r
	ON DATE(t.start_date) = r.rain_date
	ORDER BY duration DESC
	)
SELECT
	rainytripdate,
	rainytrips.trip_id,
	MAX(duration) max_duration
FROM rainytrips
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY max_duration DESC
